## Properties
- Fully responsive - can be viewed on desktop and mobile platforms.
- Burger menu navigation bar for mobile devices to navigate between content.
- My CV can be viewed upon clicking the 'resume' button which will take the user(s) to a public Google Drive folder that has my CV in both word and PDF format to view.
- There is a dark mode feature that can be toggled on and off with the sun icon (for light mode) or the moon icon (for dark mode).
- Once the user reaches the bottom page there is an arrow they can press that takes them back to the top of the page.
- Coding languages (skills) list - I decided to put this towards the bottom under my projects area because I already have my skills list in my CV, and some of those skills are listed in my projects card under the project descrion.

Wish me luck on my job hunt to becoming a frontend developer!
